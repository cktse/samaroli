## Build Notes
- First time getting into watercooling -- planning and bending hardline PETG tubes was hard but a lot of fun!
- Getting all the RGB wired up was unexpectedly challenging. Gigabyte Z390 Designare motherboard supports only 12V ARGB (analog) but not 5V DRGB (digital). I ended up with mixed ARGB and DRGB devices connected to the analog motherboard using Gamer Storm's DRGB to ARGB converter hub. I was able to synchronize RGB via Gigabyte's AmbientLED app -- very barebone but servicable. Note that some of the lighting effects are not perfect, but good enough for what I want.
- ThermalTake fans use a proprietary combined fan PWM + RGB connector. I used TT Sync Controller as a fan hub and route its standard 5V DRGB output through the RGB converter hub.
- Lian Li O11 Dynamic XL case comes with 4x USB 3.0/2.0 ports (plus an USB 3.1 Type C port). I used an internal USB 3.0/2.0 hub PCB connected to F_USB30 (HS05/SS05 and HS06/SS06) to support all 4 physical ports.
- This is also my first OpenCore build. For my own learning and education, I chose not to take a pre-built EFI package as-is. I followed Dortania's very well-written [OpenCore Desktop Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/) to customize my own config.plist and SSDT's -- the idea is that I want to understand the exact purpose of every changes to the sample.plist before I add to mine.
- CaseSJ's incredibly detailed [guide](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/success-gigabyte-designare-z390-thunderbolt-3-i7-9700k-amd-rx-580.267551/) on this motherboard also provided a wealth of information to explore (the thread is 2,254 pages long as of this writing!)

# Unobvious problems to watch out for
--To unlock writing to MSR 0xE2 register for native NVRAM support, initially I went for the latest beta firmware version F9H (as of this writing, the latest official BIOS version is F9B which is locked.)  However, while it could boot into the O/S perfectly fine, I could not ESC into the BIOS setup screen -- got a blank screen from both the dGPU and iGPU DisplayPort output. I ended up downgrading into F9G, which is also still in beta as of this writing, and everything worked fine.
--After a period of flawless burn-in, it suddenly failed to boot into POST after switching power off and back on. The BIOS error status LED's on the motherboard was stuck at the "DRAM" LED in an infinite reboot cycle. BIOS reset pins, holding power button down trick etc. did nothing. Taking out some/all RAM modules also didn't seem to work. I switched off the power, removed the onboard battery, and let it sit overnight -- same error next morning. After many frustrating hours of trial-and-error, I noticed an important detail which I had missed until now: version numbers printed on the sticker on the RAM modules are different! I bought 2 separate packs of 2 x 16G each, and apparently there is no way to figure out without first opening the packaging -- I got version both 4.31 and 5.32, and only 5.32 is officially supported according to Gigabyte's [Memory Support List](https://download.gigabyte.com/FileList/Memory/mb_memory_z390-designare_200103.pdf) I was able to get pass POST once again with 2 sticks of 5.32! Moral of the story: read the fineprints!
